PUT _ilm/policy/delete-after-30d

      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {

2 If you already have old indexes and want to apply this policy, you need to update the settings (_Settings) to each index or use the appropriate wildcard.
PUT */_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.lifecycle.name": "delete-after-30d"
  }
}
